# C_Project_1
This C project is a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user inputs for two numbers and an operator, processes the inputs, and outputs the result of the calculation. At this I use some conditional statements, switch case etc.
